1. Is the Python Standard Library included with PyInputPlus?
Ans-
No, pyinputplus in thirds party library which provides additional feature to take input from python , it may take some modules from python standered library .
But it does not include entire library.
pyinputplus provides many feature to take input like input handilng , input validation and time out for input prompt.

2. Why is PyInputPlus commonly imported with import pyinputplus as pypi?
Ans-
Pyinputplus is imported as pypi beacuse it give easy way to metion in code and function while writing and which makes code more readable and maintenable.
and that also avoids conflicts in writing code.

3. How do you distinguish between inputInt() and inputFloat()?
Ans-
Here both are function of pyinputplus but both gives different access of work as belo 
inpitInt() - given limit to user to enter only integer while data will be more accurate and confilctsless when you need integer as input.
inputFloat() gives you access to limit user to enter only Floating point number to make your data more desireable and easy to readable for machine and human.

4. Using PyInputPlus, how do you ensure that the user enters a whole number between 0 and 99?
Ans-
We can use below code or we can defire this code as function for set user to enter number between 0 to 99.

import pyinputplus as pyip

number = pyip.inputInt(prompt="Enter a whole number between 0 and 99: ", min=0, max=99)

5. What is transferred to the keyword arguments allowRegexes and blockRegexes?
Ans- Here with above function we can provide a restricted limit to user to provide the input or we can block unwanted input by using 
below.
allowRegex()- here we can provide only wanted input which we are expacting from user else we can hold the opration 
blockRegex() - here we can provide an restriction to limit the user input with unwanted input.

6. If a blank input is entered three times, what does inputStr(limit=3) do?
Ans- In inputStr() limit provide maximum access to attempt to give input, and if user fails to do so then input prompt will be time out.
this is used  to apply in sensitive cases like passward , pin or confidetial data.

7. If blank input is entered three times, what does inputStr(limit=3, default=&#39;hello&#39;) do?
Ans-
Here in this case after exceeding the limit of input , pyinputplus will return "Hello" as default print has given instead of "Timeoutexception"
